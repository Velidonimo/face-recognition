# Face recognizing
This app takes pics from "sample" folder, 

searches the faces, 

resizes and saves into the "resized" folder.

Haarcascades for face recognizing are not perfect, but work fine for the rhight pics  
Also You can play with coeffs to get better results.

See samples in folders.

Using these haarcascades and openCV lib You can easily make a real-time face detector for webcam
